# Racing-Car-Demo
Capstone Project | Fall 2024 | CRK Racing x ETX Launchpad

This project transforms the popular Mario Kart gaming concept into a real-world, interactive racing experience using physical mini vehicles, IoT devices, and digital controls. Developed in collaboration with CRK Racing and ETX Launchpad, the system integrates embedded systems, camera sensors, Python programming, and wireless communication protocols to bring competitive gameplay and immersive fun to life.

# Project Goals
- Design and prototype a remote-controlled racing car system enhanced with virtual power-ups, real-time event responses, and track interactivity.
- Deliver a blend of engineering, software development, and user experience design to simulate a real-life Mario Kart-inspired race.

# Technical Components
- Hardware & Communication:
  * Raspberry Pi for edge computing
  * MQTT for lightweight, real-time communication between vehicles and the control hub
  * Sensors and camera modules for motion detection and track interactions

#  Software Stack:
- Python-based logic for game state and vehicle control
- C/C++ for embedded programming on microcontrollers
- OpenCV for visual tag (QR/code) detection
- Socket programming for real-time game events and multiplayer interactions

# Gameplay Mechanics:
- Power-ups triggered by scanning QR codes or visual tags on the track
- Speed boosts, traps, or vehicle behavior changes triggered programmatically
- Digital application interface for racers to control vehicles and view stats

# Objectives and Evaluation Criteria
- Provide a fun, competitive user experience while maintaining system responsiveness and stability
- Ensure reliable communication and fast execution of in-game actions
- Measure performance based on latency, accuracy of detection, and user engagement.
